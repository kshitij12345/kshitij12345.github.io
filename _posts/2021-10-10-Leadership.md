### Leadership

#### What is leadership?

Leadership can be very simply defined as making the decision and implementing those decision. To accomplish this
you need to also be able to influence people (around/below/above) you.


#### Leadership vs Management

Leadership is not necessarily about the authority or the title that a person has. 
A person who is a manager maybe or may not be a leader in the sense of above definition.
Similarly, a person who does not lead a team can be a leader. It is more about the leadership
skills than mere position.

#### Qualities of a Leader

This [blog](https://hbr.org/2016/03/the-most-important-leadership-competencies-according-to-leaders-around-the-world) talks about the skills that
a good leader has or should focus on. The skills are ranked based on the opinion of 195 leaders from around the world and different companies.
One that stood out to me was openness. Being able to admit, I am wrong and being able to improve upon that is really a skill. It is not easy to
accept one's mistakes especially if someone lower than your current title points them out. 

#### Inclusiveness

Another quality is being inclusive. Being inclusive, is prior requirement for being able to admit one's mistakes. What I mean by being inclusive here
is that the person should try to include people while making and implementing a decision. Since, it is not possible to talk to every person, the leader
should target to atleast to the sample of people which represent all the groups. The idea is to look past one's perspective and to look at the bigger picture
together. Including people also has the benefit that people feel responsible and ownership about the decision and strive harder to make sure that it is
implemented successfuly.

There is more to be a leader than this, but that's it for today!!
